# multimodel-RAG
Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI system that retrieves relevant information from multiple data types such as text and images, then uses a large language model to generate accurate, context-aware responses. It improves reliability by grounding answers in external data sources.
